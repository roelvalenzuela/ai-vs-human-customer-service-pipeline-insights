# 🤖 AI vs Human Service Pipeline & Insights

**Data pipeline and analytics project** comparing AI chatbots and human agents in customer service.  
Built with **Python, Apache Airflow, and Matplotlib**, this project automates data processing and visualization to uncover insights across metrics like **response time**, **satisfaction**, **resolution rate**, and **accuracy**.

---

## Project Overview
Customer service is evolving — but can AI truly match the human touch?  
This project analyzes chatbot and human performance data to highlight where AI excels and where human empathy still leads.

It combines **data engineering** (automated pipelines) with **analytics** (insights and visualization), designed to demonstrate both technical skill and business impact.

---

## Tech Stack & Tools
- **Python** – data manipulation and automation scripts  
- **Apache Airflow** – workflow orchestration and task scheduling  
- **Matplotlib / Pandas** – visualizations and analysis  
- **Docker (optional)** – containerized environment for Airflow  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and collaboration  

---

## Metrics & Analysis
The comparison evaluates:
- **Response Time** – how quickly each resolves a case  
- **Customer Satisfaction** – simulated or real survey scores  
- **Resolution Rate** – issues solved successfully  
- **Accuracy** – correctness of responses or solutions  

---

## Data Pipeline Flow
1. **Extract** – gather chatbot & agent data (CSV, API, or database)  
2. **Transform** – clean, normalize, and merge using Python  
3. **Load** – store structured data for analysis  
4. **Visualize** – generate insights with Matplotlib charts  

*(Automated using Airflow DAGs for reproducible results)*

---

## Example Insights
- AI responds 60% faster but has 15% lower satisfaction scores  
- Human agents handle complex queries more accurately  
- Combining both improves efficiency and experience  

*(Visualization examples will be added once charts are generated.)*

---

## Skills Demonstrated
**Python · Airflow · Data Engineering · Automation · Data Visualization · Analytics · AI Evaluation · Storytelling with Data**

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate real-time chatbot APIs  
- Add sentiment analysis using NLP models  
- Deploy Airflow pipeline with Docker Compose  
- Build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit or Power BI)
